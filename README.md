Internet Speed Test App
I developed an Internet Speed Test App using Python modules, providing users with an easy and efficient way to measure their network speed. The app utilizes the speedtest module to accurately calculate download speed, upload speed, and ping latency.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for seamless interaction.
Accurate Speed Measurement: Provides real-time data for download and upload speeds.
Ping Monitoring: Displays latency for better network diagnostics.
This app is useful for individuals and businesses to evaluate their internet performance quickly and troubleshoot connection issues effectively.
